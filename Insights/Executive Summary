## Executive Summary

The workforce is highly experienced, with nearly half of employees having more than
5 years of tenure. However, attrition is concentrated in specific departments rather
than evenly distributed across the organization.

The absence of employees with less than 1 year of tenure highlights limited recent
hiring.

Engagement scores alone do not explain attrition behavior, thus need to
focus on career growth, compensation, and role clarity is suggested.
